    "Your goal in this coursework is to implement and experiment with various explainability approaches in order to better understand the behaviour of a neural model applied to the Titanic dataset. As you will have a chance to observe, the dataset reflects some of the past social conventions and biases, which also affect the trained model. Explanations can serve as very useful tools for identifying such potential issues and gaining insight into the internal reasoning of machine learning systems."

    "**Task 2(c)**: Perform a quantitative evaluation of the different attribution methods by computing their mean [infidelity](https://captum.ai/api/metrics.html) on the full Titanic dataset. On a high level, infidelity aims to estimate how closely the generated explanations correspond with the behaviour of the explained model by slightly perturbing the inputs and measuring how much the observed change in the model output differs from the change predicted by the corresponding feature attributions (when considering a linear model with the same weights as the feature attribution scores). If you are interested, you can find more details regarding this metric in [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09392). A downside of the infidelity metric is that one needs to define a suitable perturbation function for changing the model inputs, which can significantly affect the results. In this coursework, we provide you with a perturbation function adding Gaussian noise to continuous features and performing resampling for categorical features. In your evaluation, you should experiment with two or three different standard deviations and categorical resampling probabilities. Once you are done, add a table summarising the results to your report and comment on the findings. Note that lower infidelity scores are better.\n",
